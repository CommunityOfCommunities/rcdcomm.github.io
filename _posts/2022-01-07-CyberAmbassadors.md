The CyberAmbassador program provides professional skills training for technically proficient individuals, with the goal of helping to prepare participants to lead multidisciplinary, technology-intensive research at their home institutions and workplaces.
 
 The curriculum covers three core topics (Teamwork, Leadership and Communication), which are further divided into 3 sub-modules each (9 total sub-modules). The curriculum is highly modular and can be customized at the level of individual learning goals and activities; this allows facilitators to select materials to fit into different timeframes (from 45 minutes to 20+ hours) and different delivery mechanisms (in person, live online trainings, and hybrid formats). 
 The CyberAmbasadors project also provides professional development in a fourth area: workshop facilitation skills. This “train-the-trainers” component prepares new facilitators to deliver CyberAmbassadors workshops to their own communities by familiarizing them with the curriculum; engaging them in practice facilitation activities; and providing tools and logistical support for planning, delivering, and evaluating training customized to their own audience. Individuals gain Trained Facilitator status by completing the “train the trainers” program, and can become a Certified Facilitator after leading a minimum of 4 hours of CyberAmbassadors workshops.
  
### Activities: 
Professional skills training in communication, teamwork, leadership, and workshop facilitation
   
### Services: 
* Free CyberAmbassador training  workshops to build communication, teamwork, and leadership skills are offered both in person and in live online sessions. A number of organizations regularly help to host these trainings, including Tau Beta Pi, Virtual Residency and CARCC. Training may also be available upon request depending on facilitator availability.
* Free in person “train-the-trainers” workshops (application required) to prepare Trained Facilitators to offer the CyberAmbassadors curriculum for their own institutions, professional societies, and communities. These facilitator training workshops have been on hold due to the pandemic, but we hope to resume them in the summer of 2022. We are also exploring options for providing some aspects of facilitator training in virtual formats. 
* All curriculum materials are being prepared and published under an open-source license and we expect they will be freely available upon request in 2022.

# Community of Communities (CoCo) Working Group 

Community of Communities (CoCo) is a working group that envisions connecting communities of RCD (Research Computing and Data, broadly defined) professionals, listed below, including other interested RCD groups who want to get involved, for activities that are of key relevance for RCD professionals. It advocates for the role of RCD professionals in a way that such professionals can find home organizations for themselves, exchange experiences and feel part of a community that values and incentivizes their work. The group works on mapping the RCD ecosystem and guiding people to suitable activities. CoCo was founded out of the Community of Communities Working Group from the CI Workforce Development Workshop 2020, i[https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/ciworkforce2020/](https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/ciworkforce2020/).

The work of these diverse communities are often complementary and some have funding while others rely on volunteer work. Some have exact guidelines on how to collaborate with them, descriptions of statements of work or instructions on how to receive letters of support or integrate them into proposals for funding. 

Contacting the CoCo Working Group gives researchers and projects access to a wide network of communities. The working group can provide letters of collaboration for community support and/or funded community activities in the RCD space. The possibility to reach out to the large set of groups listed above and receive consultancy on feasible roadmaps and steps.
